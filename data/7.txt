Government urged to consult courts on banning HTI
Lawmakers have urged the government to comply with legal procedures, and thus consult with the courts in taking action against any mass organization deemed to promote beliefs contradictory to the Pancasila state ideology, such as the hard-line Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) group.

Deputy chairman of House of Representatives Commission II, which oversees regional administrations, Ahmad Riza Patria, reminded the government that Law No. 17/2013 on mass organizations required the government to issue official warnings to any organization deemed problematic.

Citing the law, the politician from the Gerindra Party further highlighted the involvement of the courts in the process, saying that the government could take any “problematic” organization to court if all warnings were ignored.

“Therefore, the government cannot arbitrarily ban any [mass] organization. A court verdict is a must to validate the decision,” Riza said Monday when asked about the government’s announcement to ban the HTI.

Earlier on Monday, Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Wiranto told reporters that the government decided to ban the HTI because the organization promoted beliefs contradictory to Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution.

Several lawmakers have questioned whether the government has complied with all administrative and legal procedures, as required by the 2013 Mass Organizations Law before making the decision.

Deputy chairman of the People’s Consultative Assembly (MPR), Hidayat Nur Wahid, asked the government to uphold democratic procedures in dealing with mass organizations.

“We are living in the Reform Era. Law enforcement should be preserved. The government cannot be repressive,” Hidayat, a Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) politician, stated.
