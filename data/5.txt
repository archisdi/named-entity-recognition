HTI protests governments arbitrary move
Hard-line group Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) has objected to the government�s decision to ban the group, referring to the move as arbitrary and unconstitutional.

HTI Spokesperson Ismail Yusanto argued that HTI had not received a warning from the government in relation to the organization�s operations in the country, as required by the 2013 Mass Organizations Law

�The HTI is a legal organization. We have been operating for more than 20 years peacefully. We have never violated the law,� Ismail told reporters on Monday.

�The government�s move to ban us has raised questions because the government has never asked us for clarification or whatsoever. This is regrettable because we have never received a warning, not even one,� he added. �It is said that this is a law-based country. Thus the government must uphold the law and not act arbitrarily.�

The government has recommended banning the HTI over its activities that are deemed contradictory to the Pancasila state ideology. The move comes following a string of sectarian rallies in the country�s capital and other provinces.

The announcement has raised criticism from various groups calling for the government to comply with the law that requires the government to consult the courts in making a final decision.

�The government must uphold and comply with the principles of due process that places the court as the center of the legal process,� Institute for Policy Research and Advocacy (Elsam) researcher Wahyudi Djafar said.
