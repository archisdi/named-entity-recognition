Christian student group criticizes govt's move to ban HTI
The Indonesian Christian Students Movement (GMKI) has said it disagrees with the governments move to disband the hard-line Islamist group Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), saying it would not be in line with Pancasila values.

The GMKI stated in a press release on Tuesday that the governments "was reactive" and the move could instead "undermine democracy itself."

The GMKI also said the decision to seek a ban for the HTI reflected the governments failure to create programs to guide Pancasila values.
"Every citizen has the rights to learn about any ideologies," it stated, adding that the government's decision was a political move that could irritate Muslims in Indonesia.

"Any policies regarding organizations labelled by the government as radical or anti-Pancasila must stay in the judicial sphere, rather than making an announcement that could create public anxiety,".
